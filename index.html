          <li>INLINE CSS: Styles element directly in HTML file.  Applies to specific HTML tag.  Consists of a "style" attribute followed by a CSS rule.</li>
          <li>INTERNAL STYLE SHEET: Contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.  The rules only apply to that webpage.</li>
          <li>EXTERNAL STYLE SHEET: Links a file using "link" element containing CSS rules separately.  Makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>* is a "wild card" selector that applies all properties in the given declaration box to all visible elements on the page.</li>
          <li>You can combine multiple selector separated by commas who will share the same properties within a proceeding declaration box.</li>
          <li>Class attributes can be used as CSS selectors instead of HTML elements.  Then the class attribute can be assigned to specific elements within HTML.</li>
