# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The goal of this webpage is to provide quick access to key learning points from the bootcamp prework project that can be applied to future projects.  This will help in future bootcamp projects by providing valuable information after only brief reflection on the prework project.  It will save time in searching multiple alternative resources as well as present the information in a familiar way.

This is the developers first coding project.  It provided the opportunity to create an HTML structure for the webpage, establish an aesthetic appearance to enhance readability with CSS, provide a recommended topic to begin reading, practice GIT workflow and finally make the webpage accessible to others. 

## Usage

Navigate to the prework study guide using the following URL: https://sigros02.github.io/bootcamp-study-guide/
Choose a topic to review the lessons learned during the bootcamp prework project relating to HTML, CSS, GIT and Javascript.  For a suggestion on which topic to study, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing **Command+Option+I** (MacOS) or **Control+Shift+I** (Windows).  The DevTools should open up and you will see a **Console** tab in the DevTools.  Once **Console** is selected, you will see a list of topics along with the recommended topic to start learning first.
